2.0.0

## Changes since 1.2.4

* Docker images based on Bookworm-slim
* Docker image MariaDB used as database.
* Docker image codeenigma/ce-dev:2.x image used web image
* No more use of different predefined drupalX-web images, we rely on 'ce-dev provision'.
* Use of latest Typescript version (5.x.x)
* Binaries built with Emacs instead of Commonjs: Emacs can consume Commonjs modules,
  but Commonjs can't consume Emacs modules. It means we can use more contrib modules
* src folder has been organised a bit better.
* Removed drupal 8 and drupal 9 templates.
* The way to assign IPs have changed.
* Improved command 'shell'
* Added new command 'drush'
